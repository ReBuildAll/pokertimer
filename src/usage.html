                <p>
                    This page contains information how to use PokerTimer. It assumes you are familiar with Poker terms
                    and tournament rules.
                </p>

                <h2>The Screen</h2>

                <p>
                    PokerTimer was designed to fit on your screen all at once. This is true for desktops, but for tablets
                    and mobile phones, you might need to scroll down to see everything.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In desktop mode the center contains the most important information about the tournament.
                    The left hand side contains various parameters and the right hand side has settings. When
                    going to tablet the settings will first move to the bottom. When going mobile, the parameters
                    go below the main controls. The timer is always at the center/top.
                </p>

                <h3>Starting and stopping</h3>

                <p>
                    Right under the main timer you will see the tournament control buttons.
                </p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Start</dt>
                    <dd>This will start the clock if it is stopped or paused</dd>
                    <dt>Stop</dt>
                    <dd>This will pause the clock if it is started</dd>
                    <dt>Reset tournament</dt>
                    <dd>This will reset the tournament. All progress (levels, buyins, rebuys, etc) is lost.
                        PokerTimer will ask for your confirmation before doing this.</dd>
                    <dt>Skip level</dt>
                    <dd>This will immediately skip a level (no confirmation, no going back). Can be used to
                    skip ahead or if you forgot to start the timer to adjust for the missed time. Also if
                    you accidently reset the tournament, you can go back to where you were.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>Tournament participants</h3>

                <p>
                    On the left hand side there are multiple buttons to control the participants. Here you can add
                    or remove players and also mark rebuys and addons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Player numbers, rebuys and addons do not affect the overall flow of the timer. They are used to
                    show the amount of chips in play, and to tell you how to devide the prize money.
                </p>

                <h2>Settings</h2>

                <p>
                    There are a lot of settings you can make in PokerTimer. PokerTimer uses presets to group
                    together all settings. Settings such as buyin amount, buyin chips, levels and prize
                    sharing is all put into presets. You can have multiple presets, and change between them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All settings other than preset settings always affect the currently selected preset. To select
                    a preset, press the <strong>Presets</strong> button and choose the preset you want to load.
                </p>

                <h3>Parameters</h3>

                <h3>Prizes</h3>

                <h3>Levels</h3>

                <h2>Tips</h2>

                <p>
                    Here are some tips and tricks how to use the application.</p>                    

                <h3>Internet Explorer 9: Pin to task bar</h3>
                
                <p>IE9+ allows you to pin application to the Windows task bar. When you are on the
                   main application page of PokerTimer (NOT IN THIS USERS GUIDE!), <strong>drag</strong>
                   the TAB in which the web page is displayed to the Windows task bar.</p>
                   
                <p>From now on, you can start the application directly from there.</p>
                
                <h3>Google Chrome: Pin to desktop/startmenu/taskbar</h3>
                
                <p>Google Chrome allows a similar pinning to take place. The method is slightly different.</p>
                
                <p>Click the wrench icon (right side of address bar), select <strong>Tools</strong>, and then
                   select <strong>Create application shortcuts...</strong>. Check the desired options.
                
                <h3>Offline usage (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)</h3>
                
                <p>Poker Timer can be used offline, that is, without an internet connection. 
                   You need to visit the page once to do this - obviously you have done so by
                   reading this. After this, you can just use the same address to access
                   the application, without an internet connection.</p>
                   
                <p>You might want to bookmark the site or create application shortcust (see above)
                   so you can access the application without an internet connection.</p>
                   
                <p>This works in:<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Chrome</li>
                        <li>Mozilla Firefox (v7+)</li>
                        <li>Apple Safari (v4.0+)</li>
                        <li>iOS Safari (v3.2+)</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
            </div>            
        </div>
