## Plans for the future
This file contains rough plans of what I have in mind.

### v0.6
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Add sound for player out
- Add help overlay that would list possible keyboard shortcuts
- When last player is out, show game over, stop counting
- Add option to undo player out
- Add better error handling

### v0.x
- Support pinning for iOS, Android and Windows Phone
- Update pinning information for Chrome
- Investigate pinning in Edge
- Investigate prevent sleep options (for tablets, notebooks, etc)

### v1.0
- Desktop notifications (in case we are in background)

### v2.0 (very far future)
- Implement preset sharing over the web
